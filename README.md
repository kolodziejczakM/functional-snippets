# Functional Javascript / Typescript snippets
## This  **_Visual Studio Code_** extension provides some useful snippets listed below:

```javascript
1. iife - (function youEdit(){})();
2. fn - function youEdit(youEdit2) {}
3. fne - const youEdit = function(youEdit2) {};
4. afn - function(youEdit) {}
5. arfne - const youEdit = (youEdit2) => {};
6. arafn - (youEdit) => {}
7. mfn - youEdit.map((youEdit2) => {});
8. fefn - youEdit.forEach((youEdit2) => {});
9. sfn - youEdit.some((youEdit2) => {})
10. efn - youEdit.every((youEdit2) => {})
11. clog - console.log(youEdit)
12. clogs - console.log(`youEdit`)
13. clogw - console.warn(youEdit)
14. clogws - console.warn(`youEdit`)
15. cloge - console.error(youEdit)
16. cloges - console.error(`youEdit`)
17. umdmd - UMD module without params
18. umdmdp - UMD module with params
```
All of these snippets excluding **1, 17, 18** will work in Typescript files.
