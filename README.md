3. afn - function(youEdit) {}
4. arfne - const youEdit = (youEdit2) => {};
5. arafn - (youEdit) => {}
6. mfn - youEdit.map((youEdit2) => {})
7. ifn - youEdit.includes(youEdit2)
8. ffn - youEdit.filter((youEdit2) => {})
9. ffd - youEdit.find((youEdit2) => {})
10. fifd - youEdit.findIndex((youEdit2) => {})
11. fefn - youEdit.forEach((youEdit2) => {});
12. sfn - youEdit.some((youEdit2) => {})
13. efn - youEdit.every((youEdit2) => {})
14. clog - console.log(youEdit)
15. clogs - console.log(`youEdit`)
